# Serbian Cyrillic Latin Converter for Google Docs

This add-on for Google Docs converts Serbian text between Cyrillic and Latin scripts. It seamlessly integrates into your Google Docs interface by adding a custom "Serbian Converter" menu with two options:

- **Convert to Latin:** Transforms selected Serbian Cyrillic text (or the entire document if no text is selected) into Latin script.
- **Convert to Cyrillic:** Transforms selected Serbian Latin text (or the entire document if no text is selected) into Cyrillic script.

Simply install the script in your Google Docs via **Marketplace**, and the custom menu will appear each time you open a document.

This lightweight, free add-on provides an easy solution for switching between the two Serbian scripts without leaving your document.
